## 📌 Concepts Covered

* Classes & Objects
* Constructors
* `ArrayList` usage
* Method Overriding (`equals` and `hashCode`)
* Encapsulation (private fields + public methods)
* User input using `Scanner`
* Simple Menu-Driven Interface

---

## 📋 Notes

* Students are uniquely identified by their `student_id`.
* `equals()` method in `Student` class is overridden to enable searching and deleting by ID.
* You can extend this to store data in a file or database.
